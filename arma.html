<p>CO-OP: Arma 3 comes packed with traditional co-operative scenarios, but also introduces asymmetric co-op in its Seize and Defend modes, where players can choose to co-operate or compete against a powerful enemy, with both avenues coming with their own benefits and consequences. </p>
  
    <br>  

<p>COMPETE: Should you choose to strike out on your own and wage war against your fellow players, you can. Arma 3 comes with no capped player limit, allowing for massive player vs player operations across the vast expanse of The Republic of Altis and Stratis. In the new Seize and Defend game modes, players can choose to compete against each other in a race to the finish.</p>
   
   <br>
    
<p>END GAME: In this brand new multiplayer mode, two sides fight against a common enemy to secure enough Intel - gathered by completing a number of small objectives - to identify a final 'End Game' objective. The game mode is comprised of 3 distinct phases: establishing an FOB, downloading intelligence and, finally, securing valuable schematics.</p>
    
    <br>
    
    
<p>ARMA 3 ZEUS: Assume the role of game master and influence the multiplayer experience of others. Wielding an intuitive real-time editor, you can invent new stories, challenges and locations. The result is always unique, always dynamic combat - for both Zeus and, especially, those with boots on the ground. Arma 3 Zeus - Your Rules, Your War.</p>
    
    <br>
    
<p>COMMUNITY CONTENT: As always, all missions created in Arma 3's Editor can be played in multiplayer. Improvements to the scripted framework of the game, along with a massive focus on improving the usability and behavior of Modules, have made making multiplayer missions easier and more intuitive than ever before. The community has created entire game modes that have exploded in popularity including, but not limited to, Wasteland, AAS, Domination, and much more.</p>
