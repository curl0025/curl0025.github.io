      <p class="h1">Welcome to my personal video game website!</p>
    <p class="h2">Video games have always been a big part of my life. This is a blog type website that shows some of my personal views on certain games. It can also give you some ideas about a game before purchasing/trying it
     </p>
     
     <p class="h2">Here is my list of upcoming games to be excited about</p>

  <p class="h1">Battlefront 2</p>
  <div class="text-center">

    </div>

<div class="container">
<p>Battlefront 2 will be a huge improvement over the first game. First off, Battlefront 1
did not have a campaign at all which the new game will. The campaign takes place after the
destruction of the second deathstar (between Episode VI: Return of The Jedi and Episode VII:
The Force Awakens).
You will play as Iden Versio, a specialist Imperial trooper. The story will mostly
follow her journey, but will occasionally switch perspective.
Multiplayer will also be a big improvement. There will be four classes to play - now known to be
Assault, Heavy, Specialist, and Officer. Each of these classes can be customized. Probably the most
exciting thing coming up for multiplayer are the heroes. Here is a list of the known heroes
that will be available to us to play as.</p>

    </div>

<div class="list">
<ul class="list-unstyled">
   
    <ul>
        <li>Yoda</li>
        <li>Rey</li>
        <li>Luke Skywalker</li>
        <li>Han Solo</li>
        <li>Chewbacca</li>
        <li>Darth Maul</li>
        <li>Kylo Ren</li>
        <li>Boba Fett</li>
        <li>Iden Versio</li>
        
    </ul>
</ul>

<p class="h3">Battlefront 2 will be released on November 17, 2017 for PC, PS4, and Xbox One.</p>

<p class="h1 . cod">Call of Duty: WWII</p>

    <p>This is a very exciting one. The Call of Duty franchise will be going back to its good old days. In recent times there has been a lot of dissapointments with these games such as Infinite Warfare. The game is a futuristic space fighting warfare and most players hated the direction they were going in. I think Activision got their message loud and clear. 
The campaign will take players across Europe. It will focus on the actions of a 12 man squad of the 1st Infantry Division from 1944 to 1945 in the European theatre of conflict, at a time when the Allied forces were starting to gather strength into their march into Germany. Some of the iconic historical battles covered in the campaign will be the Invasion of Normandy (D-Day), Liberation of Paris, Battle of Aachen, Battle of Hürtgen Forest, and Battle of the Bulge. 
In multiplayer players can choose one out of five divisions, each with their own different basic combat training, division training and weapon skills. This also eliminates perks, as players need to progress through ranks in divisions in order to use additional skills. Five divisions featured in the game are:
Infantry: Equipped for mid to long ranged combat. Special skill is the bayonet charge. 
Airborne: Moves fast while remaining quiet. Abilities to attach suppressors to sub machine guns that hide muzzle flash and and silence gunfire.
Armored: Heaviest firepower such as machine guns, and rocket launchers.  
Mountain: long range combat, making sniper rifles more precise with aim assist and improving the aim through scope by blocking out surroundings from player's view. 
Expeditionary: Shotguns used by players in this division have incendiary rounds that burn enemies to death.

<p class="h1 . game-3">Red Dead Redemption 2</p>

<div class="text-center">

    <p>The first Red Dead Redemption was a huge hit in 2010 for consoles. While we don’t know much yet we do know a little bit about the story setting. It looks like we will be closely following the crimes of Dutch’s gang, which you might remember from John Marston’s back story in the first game. The Blackwater settlement on the leaked map is lacking the train tracks seen in Red Dead Redemption, set in 1911, suggesting to some that it could be a prequel. However, rumours suggest that we will not be playing as John Marston.
