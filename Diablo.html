       <p>Diablo 2 is hands down one of the most addictive games I have ever played. I first started playing back in elementary school and played for years after that. Even when I took a break from it I found myself eventually going back. It is a fun hack and slash game that also has an amazing story.</p>

        <p>Diablo II takes place after the end of the previous game, Diablo, in the world of Sanctuary. In Diablo, an unnamed warrior defeated Diablo and attempted to contain the Lord of Terror's essence within his own body. Since then, the hero has become corrupted by the demon's spirit, causing demons to enter the world around him and wreak havoc.

A band of adventurers who pass through the Rogue Encampment hear these stories of destruction and attempt to find out the cause of the evil, starting with this corrupted "Dark Wanderer." As the story develops, the truth behind this corruption is revealed: the soulstones were originally designed to capture the Prime Evils who were banished to the mortal realm after being overthrown by the Lesser Evils. With the corruption of Diablo's soulstone, the demon is able to control the Dark Wanderer. The soulstone of another demon, Baal, was united with the mage Tal-Rasha, who volunteered to absorb Baal's spirit in his own body and be imprisoned in a tomb.</p>
   
   <br>
   
   <p>As the story progresses, cut scenes show the Dark Wanderer's journey as a drifter named Marius follows him. The player realizes that the Dark Wanderer's mission is to reunite with the other prime evils, Baal and Mephisto.</p>

   <p>The game is pretty straight forward. Your main objective is to take down the three prime evils Mephisto, Baal, and Diablo. Along the way you will be dealing with their army of demons and lesser evils. If you are looking for a fun, addictive game with a great story and don't mind dealing with an old game then Diablo 2 is for you. It has and always will be my favourite game and I still play to this day.</p>
