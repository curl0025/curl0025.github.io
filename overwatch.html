<p>Overwatch is a team-based multiplayer online first-person shooter video game developed and published by Blizzard Entertainment. It was released in May 2016 for Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

Overwatch assigns players into two teams of six, with each player selecting from a roster of 25 pre-defined characters, known as heroes, each with a unique style of play, whose roles are divided into four general categories: Offense, Defense, Tank, and Support. Players on a team work together to secure and defend control points on a map or escort a payload across the map in a limited amount of time. Players gain cosmetic rewards that do not affect gameplay, such as character skins and victory poses, as they play the game. The game was initially launched with casual play, with a competitive ranked mode, various 'arcade' game modes, and a player-customizable server browser subsequently included following its release. Additionally, Blizzard has developed and added new characters, maps, and game modes post-release, while stating that all Overwatch updates will remain free, with the only additional cost to players being microtransactions to earn additional cosmetic rewards.</p>

<p>The best thing I can say about Overwatch is the amount of characters you can choose from. There are currently 25, each with their own unique styles of combat. 
   It is great to have a large amount of characters because it will keep you in the game and will not leave you easily bored. Although, many people like myself have certain characters that they play all the time. 
   For example, I main Hanzo because I find that I play the best with him. If I am not playing as Hanzo, I'm most likely blasting grenades at people and settings traps with JunkRat. Overall I would say that this game is good for someone 
   who likes to try out many characters with different rolls and that likes to play a game with a main purpose of defending a control point.
