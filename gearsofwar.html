        <p>Gears of War is a video game franchise created and originally owned by Epic Games, developed and managed by The Coalition, and owned and published by Microsoft Studios. The series focuses on the conflict between humanity, the subterranean reptilian hominids known as the Locust Horde, and their mutated counterparts, the Lambent and the Swarm. The franchise consists of five third-person shooter video games, which has also been supplemented by a comic book series and five novels. The first installment, titled Gears of War, was released on November 7, 2006 for the Xbox 360. The game follows protagonist Marcus Fenix, a soldier in the Coalition of Ordered Governments tasked to lead a last-ditch effort to destroy the Locust Horde and save humanity. Two subsequent titles, Gears of War 2 (2008) and Gears of War 3 (2011), continued Fenix and humanity’s ongoing conflict with the Locust Horde and Lambent forces. In 2013, Epic Games and Microsoft released Gears of War: Judgment, a prequel to the series’ first title, which instead focuses on Damon Baird, one of Fenix's squad-mates. Gears of War: Ultimate Edition was released for Microsoft Windows on March 1, 2016. The series' third sequel, Gears of War 4, is set 25 years after Gears of War 3 and follows Marcus Fenix's son, JD, as he battles new foes that threaten humanity.</p>

       <p>The first Gears of War game is my favourite, but I have to talk a bit about the newest game (Gears of War 4). The newest Gears of War was a huge hit. The campaign is amazing. Everything is great about it accept for one little thing. Do NOT get this game for PC if you want to play multiplayer. I made this mistake unfortunately. I bought it for PC since I don't have an Xbox One so I played the campaign, was very happy. Then I go online and only to find out that there are no PC players what so ever. There are no dedicated PC servers, no community at all. There is only cross platform in quickplay which means you can't choose what game type you want. You have to play whatever game you jump into. I am hoping there will be a future for the PC side of this game. Full cross platform would be great but it hasn't happened because of PC advantage concerns. To sum it all up, the Gears of War franchise is amazing. If you want to experience an amazing campaign I highly reccomend starting at the very beginning. Just don't buy the newest game for PC if you want to play multiplayer!</p>
