        <p>This one is straight from the heart. The good old RuneScape. Old School is
        Jagex's official term for a previous version of the RuneScape game that was 
        introduced from a backup of the source code as it been on August 10, 2007.
        This version of the game was announced in a news post on 13 February 2013, which was followed by the opening of a poll to determine community interest on 15 February 2013. The poll, which ended 1 March 2013, decided, among other things, whether an additional membership fee would be charged for access to the game. Despite it having originally been stated that servers would take one to two months to be opened following a successful poll, on 22 February 2013, as part of an early access scheme, Jagex opened over 50 Old School RuneScape servers and gave a month of free Old School RuneScape membership credit to all of those who had voted in the poll. The game quickly saw player counts equalling those of the main version of the game.</p>

        <p>You might be thinking "So what? the game looks even better" People that grew up playing RuneScape back in the day understand what I am about to talk about. The old game is what we knew and loved. Just thinking about it gives me total nostalgia. The game was also very unique in its own way. People didn't care about graphic updates because the game wasn't about that. It was about making new friends, finishing quests, leveling your stats or simply just hanging out. The game was perfect the way it was. Once the new updates came along I was dissapointed but got used to it. Then the big update came called EOC (Evolution Of Combat) which pretty much killed the game for me. This update was bascially making a whole new combat system that changed the game completely. So at this point the graphics and combat are totally different. This is why Old School is around. Even though it will never be the same as the good old days, Old School is here to stay.</p>
